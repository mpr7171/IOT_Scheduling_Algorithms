FCFS scheduling is fair in the sense that it treats patients in the order they arrive.However, it may not be the most efficient option, as it doesn't consider the urgency of patients.

Priority Scheduling is the most efficient and fair scheduling algorithm as it considers patient urgency, ensuring critical cases are prioritized. It balances efficiency and fairness in medical care.

SJF Scheduling is efficient but may not be fair from a medical perspective, as it prioritizes based on treatment time, not urgency.

Round Robin Scheduling is fair in terms of treating all patients equally but may not efficiently prioritize urgent cases.


The most suitable algorithm would likely be Priority Scheduling. This algorithm balances both efficiency (by considering urgency) and fairness (by addressing medical needs).
